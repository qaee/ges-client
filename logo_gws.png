The image you provided appears to be a golden/yellow circular logo with the letter "G" design. I can see it's a stylized logo but I cannot directly convert the image to PNG format. 

To properly save this as logo_gws.png, you'll need to:
1. Save the image file directly from your source
2. Or provide the image in a format I can process

For the environment variable issue, let me check your current environment and help you reload your shell properly.
